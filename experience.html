        <p>September of 2000, I joined the Air Force as a <strong>2R1 Maintenance Production Manager</strong>. I was in charge of ensuring maintenance of our aircraft was conducted in a way that allowed us to complete our missions everyday.</p>
        <p>In 2004 I crosstrained to the <strong>3C2 Tech Control</strong> career. Tech Controllers are nicknamed <em>"Water Walkers"</em> because they have to know so much about so many technologies that it's a miracle! As a Tech Controller I was in charge of ensuring our network infrastructure was secure and operational at all times.</p>

        <p>I retired from the Air Force in 2010, and shortly afterwards I began working at Georgia Tech as an <strong>Accommodations Specialist</strong>.</p>
        <p>As an Accommodations Specialist, I help people with disabilities find technology that can help them be more independent.</p>
        <p>The program I work for is called <strong>Tools for Life</strong>. My role is to be the eyes and ears of the team when it comes to cutting edge and emerging technologies!</p>
        <p>I specialize in Smart Home technologies, Accessible Gaming Solutions, and 3d Printed Assistive Technology.</p>
        <p>I love helping improve the lives of others!</p>
